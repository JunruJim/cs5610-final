## Project

Title of our project, 'Foodphilia', is a combination of 'food' and 'philia', which means crazy fan of food! Under this name, food and restaurant are the core element in our project.

#####Problem Statement

We love foods! And we need some web application to address nearby restaurants. Although Yelp did a mostly great job, there are still something to be improved. 

The first thing is there are not professional food bloggers in Yelp while there are many in Instagram and we want to do the both in same web application.

The second is information of restaurants in yelp is not always represented in a very useful way.

The third is that the Google Map API used by Yelp is just a static image! Although it is easy to implement, it would be inconvenient for users to find the location.

##### Proposed Solution

For the first problem, we used Yelp API as basic and added professional blog as one of our main features to combine these two into one web service.

For the second, we use our own database, and hence we can make these information more helpful because we can use optimized information set.

For the third, we use Google Maps JS API (not the static one) to enable more operations (zoom in, zoom out and drag, etc.) on the map.
